# Benchmarking of database approaches

This project aims at comparing different approaches to database management

## The model

The benchmarking case-study is a CD collection. See dbagile/announced.yaml for a relational
model.

## Challenges

### Challenge n°1

Display the list of all performers (relatively small table), in any order. Each line should be
of the following form:

    #{id}: #{first_name} #{last_name}

### Challenge n°2

Display the list of all tracks (relatively big table), in any order. Each line should be
of the following form:

    #{id}: #{title}

### Challenge n°3

Display the title of each album, together with the name of the performer. Each line should be
of the following form:

    #{title}: #{first_name} #{last_name}
